The lakes of Ounianga form the remainder of a larger lake that occupied the basin 5,000 to 15,000 years ago. They occupy a total area of ​​20 km2 and form the largest lake complex in the Sahara. The evaporation rate of the lakes is one of the highest in the world and the region experiences virtually no precipitation. The lakes are mainly fed by the fossil water table, created when the climate of the area was not desert, and which outcrops here .A better understanding of the environmental history and ecological resilience of these lakes can help better prepare for the global changes that are to come."
